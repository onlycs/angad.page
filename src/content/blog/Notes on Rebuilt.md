## 5.3/Zones

- Robot starting line is on border of alliance-zone and bumps.
- Tags should be seeable enough to calibrate early-on... camera angle?

## 5.4/Hub

- Long distance shooting is doable... check w/ mech+design

## 5.5/Bump

- 6.5in (nice) tall, 73in wide...
- **must** slow down in auto/repulsor

## 5.6/Trench

- Trench clearance is 22.25in tall
- Would be nice to fit under, but giving up $\infty$ balls may not be worth it

## 5.7/Depot

- Athena or Botini-style ground intake (see mech+design)

## 5.8/Tower

- Go for an Tyr-style climb, probably.
- See climbing clearance, we should be able to do at least L2
  - (i.e. climb to L1 $\rightarrow$ L2).
  - Figure out how swinging would work with only one arm to hold on

## 5.9.2/Outpost

- We may want to be able to intake this way
- If not, ground intake should be reliable enough (see mech)

## 5.11/AprilTags

- Are all over the place
- See if we can start either in the middle or in front of 14+13+12 or 7 to get a good reading
  - May need to mount $\gt 1$ camera, or orient robot to start
  - Will be better with predetermined starting orientation

## 6.4/Periods

- each shift is 25 seconds, what to do during time off? Defense? Hoarding? Check S+S
