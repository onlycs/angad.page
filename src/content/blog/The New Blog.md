Today, I re-did my blog. I still write in Markdown, but this version *should* be a bit nicer to use and look at.

This post is going to be a short one, I don't have too much to say. This whole endeavor took me like, a day.
## Astro
Astro is a content-based static site generation tool, I'm pretty sure. What's very neat is that you can mix-and-match other web frameworks (React, Vue, etc). and use them as statically generated components... in the same website. This is weirdly cursed.

Anyways, this website is built using [a template](https://github.com/jktrn/astro-erudite) [^1] I found online. I take absolutely zero credit for anything here *except* for my posts. Thanks, random internet man!
## Deployment
I went ahead and used [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) to deploy this one. Why? GitHub Pages can be a pain in the ass sometimes. This one was like click-click-go. As a bonus, I can now put this website on my apex domain[^2].

[^1]: whose name I *still* don't know how to pronounce, by the way

[^2]: i.e. [angad.page](https://angad.page/) itself instead of, e.g., blog.angad.page
