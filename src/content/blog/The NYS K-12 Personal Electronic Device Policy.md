Let me preface this by saying I don't (really) have a problem with the no-phones restrictions. I do think that it's pretty crucial to have access to your phone in case of an _actual_ emergency but, realistically, those are few and far between. Phone use during class time, etc., was a little out of hand, especially in the non-AP/non-honors classes.

What really annoys me about the policy is two things:

## 1. The Chromebook Experience

The new policy applies to "**all** internet-enabled personal electronic devices," _including_ laptops. This means that I cannot take my personal laptop to school, and I am forced to use my school Chromebook.

I hope it goes without saying that I cannot code[^1] on a piece-of-shit Intel Celeron and a complete lack of RAM[^2]. The computer is such a piece of shit that I cannot run VSCode in a _web browser_ (remoting into my home computer) without the computer freezing every five seconds. And here I thought Google was supposed to be halfway decent at coding.

Also annoying: I cannot access my beautiful [Angad Drive](https://drive.angad.page) (which contains all of my college application information, by the way), my personal email, literally CommonApp, any of it. The laptops' filtering are done on a whitelist: We're basically only allowed to access Google Drive and Google Classroom.

## 2. I'm not a brainrotted child

Our schools are treating everyone like small, brainrotted iPad kids. I'm (nearly) a grown-ass adult. Some of my friends are already 18! We do not need to be babied around like this, and it's frankly disrespectful that we are.

I did say before that phone use was getting out of hand, but that's only because for every infraction, teachers interrupt their entire lesson to tell that one kid to their phone away. In stark contrast, we have college professors, who will teach their lecture regardless of whether some students are on their phones.

## 3. A Solution?

I'm not arguing that a good high school education is not essential for students, it is. I also agree that the use of phones during that instructional period detriment students' learning.

But you see, we already have a system to deal with students who don't pay attention in class—it's called _grades_. Basically, when a kid does bad in school[^3], hold them back a grade until they pass their classes. I know, mindblowing.

[^1]: I actually do need to code during the day, especially when robotics season starts.

[^2]: The documentation says it was 8GB of RAM but mentioning that, at least in the main body, is rhetorically ineffective because it sounds reasonable and does not do justice to how slow the piece of shit runs. Thanks, AP Lang.
